# Python Genshin Card Character Build Maker
I dunno how to name it, coz I'm bad at it. But, hey! You got it right. It's a card maker of your character. Share your build and flex it to your friend LOL. Made this just playing around with computer vision especially with opencv.

Example of card:
![Example Card](https://github.com/yoshiumikuni/py-chara-build-maker/blob/main/res.png "This is a sample image.")

#### Current Limitation 
- i'm not testing on other computer with larger resolution screen (mine 1366x768).
- works best on 1366x768 screen resolution.
- the result kinda bit stretched (i'll fix it later, if i have time.. and will).
- you need follow the instruction showed on terminal. (yeah, you cant spam the screenshot)
- need run as Admin, if not the program can't take the screenshot.

# Prerequisite
You need install this following library:
- Python ver. 3.7++
- Pillow
- OpenCV
- matplotlib 
- pyautogui `pip install pyautogui`
- keyboard `pip install keyboard`

# Usage
- clone this repo or download as zip
- **open command prompt (As Administrator)** then redirect to repo folder
- run this command : `py main_program.py`
- start taking screenshot
- the result card will be in main dir named `res.png`

Should I make it to executable file?
