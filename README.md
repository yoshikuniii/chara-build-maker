# Python Genshin Card Character Build Maker
I dunno how to name it, coz I'm bad at it. But, hey! You got it right. It's a card maker of your character. Share your build and flex it to your friend LOL. Made this just playing around with computer vision especially with opencv.

#### current limitation 
- i'm not testing on other computer with larger resolution screen (mine 1366x768).
- works best on 1366x768 screen resolution.
- the result kinda bit stretched (i'll fix it later, if i have time.. and will).
- you need follow the instruction on showed on terminal. (yeah, you cant spam the screenshot)

# prerequisite
You need install this following library:
- python ver. 3.7++
- Pillow
- OpenCV
- matplotlib 
- pyautogui `pip install pyautogui`
- keyboard `pip install keyboard`

# Usage
`py main_program.py`
